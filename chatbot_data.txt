Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

key steps include data collection, data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims to find patterns or structure within the data.

the difference between classification and regression in machine learning
Classification predicts discrete labels or categories, while regression predicts continuous numerical values.

Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, or creating features from the raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models.

A decision tree is a predictive model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions by splitting the data into subsets based on the values of input features.
